What is CodeTime

CodeTime is a command line utility for tracking the hours you spend programming. CodeTime allows you to either start a time tracker when you begin a coding session and stop it when you finish a coding session; or, you can set a time limit for your session and CodeTime will notify you when you reach your time goal. There are also some other great features such as viewing your session history and pausing sessions.
